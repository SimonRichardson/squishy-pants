## Alternatives

If you're looking for a serious functional programming library one that derives a lot from Haskell
and Category Theory then consider looking into [bilby.js](https://github.com/puffnfresh/bilby.js).
A lot of the ideas in bilby.js are also found in squishy-pants, but squishy-pants takes a more
Functional Reactive Programming approach.

There is also [lemonad](https://github.com/fogus/lemonad) which is in the similar vein to bibly.js
and squishy-pants, with the aid of it's very good companion book [Functional Javascript](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028857.do).
